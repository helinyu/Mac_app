SFBPopovers
===========

This framework implements popover windows- windows that, to the user, logically belong to another window and are visually attached to the parent window.

Although the majority of the code was written by me, the inspiration came from two similar products:

1. [MAAttachedWindow][1] by Matt Gemmell
2. [INPopoverController][2] by Indragie Karunaratne

Each has its strong points, but in the end I decided to combine the best features of both into my own framework.
